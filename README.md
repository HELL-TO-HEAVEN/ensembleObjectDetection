# Ensemble Object Detection
In this project, we show the benefits of using an ensemble algorithm that can be applied with any object detection model independently of the underlying algorithm. In addition, our ensemble method has been employed to define a test-time augmentation procedure for object detection models. We have used with several datasets and algorithms.
