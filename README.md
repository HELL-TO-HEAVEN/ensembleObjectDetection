# Ensemble Object Detection
In this project, we show the benefits of using an ensemble algorithm that can be applied with any object detection model independently of the underlying algorithm. In addition, our ensemble method has been employed to define a test-time augmentation procedure for object detection models.We have tested our methods with several datasets and algorithms.

### Colab Notebooks for prediction
You can use the methods with the following notebooks.

- [Test Time Augmentation Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T1mn85AedRlaTNHeJW_QeTy0I5wOy14J)
- [Ensemble Model Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Tg9WaI_Cd-lPXDMuj6tHDlqakxo4-CLK)


## Test Time Augmentation
We provides the necessary tools to apply ensemble methods and test-time augmentation. This open-source library canbe  extended  to  work  with  any  object  detection  model  indepen-dently of the algorithm and framework employed to construct it.
